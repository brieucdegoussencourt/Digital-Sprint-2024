The project consists on creating a simple game where the user interacts with the computer to guess a whole number between 1 and 100. User has 10 guesses to succeed. Display messages must appear depending on result.

### 2. Code structure

*	Create a function that generates a random number between 1 and 100

*   Create a function that manages one round of play and countdown
  
	*  Check if the player guess is correct, too high or too low and inform him/her
	* Returns a message accordingly
 
*   Create a loop for managing the game

  * Ask the player to enter name and number
  * Count rounds
  * Ensure that the number is valid and included in the interval 1-100
  * Use the functions created above to generate a number and check if the player guessed correctly
  *   If the player guesses correctly the loop should stop and a congratulations message should appear: “You guessed the correct number in XX rounds”
  *   If the number is not guessed after 10 rounds, a message should appear: “You failed, try again!”
