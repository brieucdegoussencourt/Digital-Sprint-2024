    "A function is a block of code in a program that performs a specific task. It takes one or more inputs, known as arguments, and returns a value or performs some action based on those inputs. Functions are used to break down complex programs into smaller, more manageable pieces. As a result the code is easier to write, test and maintain.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Function blocks begin with the keyword `def` followed by the function name and brackets `()`. As for the variables, the function name should be meaningful and self-explained (we must be able to understand the behaviour of the function by reading its name)\n",
    "- The (optional) input parameters should be placed within these brackets.\n",
    "- The code block within every function starts with a colon `:` and is indented.\n",
    "- The `return` statements exits a function, optionally passing back a result to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as `return None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are always two \"stages\" for a function:\n",
    "- Its definition (starting with `def`): defines what to do based on expected parameters\n",
    "- Its call: executes the function with given arguments\n",
