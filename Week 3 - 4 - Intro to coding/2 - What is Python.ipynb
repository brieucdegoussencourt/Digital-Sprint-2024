These languages allow humans to write **code**, which is a set of instructions that a computer can understand and execute. Programming languages provide a structured way to define and perform tasks, such as calculations, data processing, or controlling hardware. They act as a bridge between human-readable ideas and the binary language that computers use to process information.\n","\n","Python is one of the most **user-friendly** programming languages. It's popular among newcomers because (1) it's easy to learn (2) it's used for a variety of tasks, such as creating websites, analyzing data, and automating repetitive tasks. With Python, you can create programs to solve problems, organize information, or even build your own games and applications.\n","\n","Like each human language, each programming language has its own syntax: this is a set of rules that defines how the program will be written and interpreted by the computer. We will discover this today.\n","\n","All along your Python track in the Digital sprint, we will use **notebooks**. This is a format of Python file that allows you to execute and test python code interactively. We will do it though [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) which is directly implemented into Google Drive. You can directly open the files from there. We ask you to create a copy of the files in your own folder in order to be able to save your progress. To do so, you can:\n","\n","- Click on _Copy to Drive_ (in the top menu bar)\n","- Move the copy into your own folder of the common repo by using _File_ > _Move_\n","\n","Then you can execute each box of code (`cell`) by clicking on the `Play` button at the left of the cell."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"M8R3oFXtEs5T"},"source":["## Python's philosophy\n","\n","Python's design philosophy prioritizes simplicity, readability, and ease of use, as outlined in the Zen of Python, a collection of guiding principles written by Tim Peters. Key principles include:\n","\n","1. Readability counts: Python emphasizes clear and easily understandable code, using indentation to define code blocks and avoiding complex syntax.\n","2. Less is more: Python values simplicity and conciseness, preferring a obvious way to achieve a task rather than multiple and complex ways.\n","3. Explicit is better than implicit: Python encourages code that is easy to understand and avoids hidden behaviors or assumptions.\n","4. Practicality over purity: While Python strives for simplicity and elegance, it also acknowledges the importance of practical solutions to real-world problems.\n","\n","Magic, no?

This process is called **syntax highlighting**. Each Python element is associated to a certain color and it helps programmers to quickly distinguish between different parts of the code. This is not implemented in Python itself but this is used in most IDEs (integrated development environments). An IDE is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools and features to assist programmers in writing, editing, debugging, and running code efficiently.
